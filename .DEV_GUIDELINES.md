# Development Guidelines for Jeffy E-commerce Platform

## Core Principle: Use Widely Tested Patterns

**Always build using patterns and implementations that are widely used and tested in the industry.**

### Why This Matters

- Reduces bugs and edge cases
- Improves user experience (familiar patterns)
- Easier maintenance and future updates
- Better performance and security
- Faster development cycles

### Examples of Good Patterns

✅ **Do Use:**
- Standard e-commerce variant selection (radio/dropdown + quantity)
- Established form patterns (validation, error states)
- Common UI components from libraries like Radix UI, shadcn/ui
- Industry-standard checkout flows
- Proven authentication patterns (Supabase Auth, NextAuth)

❌ **Avoid:**
- Custom multi-variant quantity systems
- Experimental UI patterns
- "Clever" but non-standard solutions
- Building from scratch when libraries exist

### When Considering New Features

1. **Research first**: Check how major e-commerce sites (Amazon, Shopify, Stripe) implement similar features
2. **Use libraries**: Don't reinvent the wheel - use battle-tested packages
3. **Follow conventions**: Stick to established patterns users expect
4. **Test thoroughly**: Ensure compatibility across devices/browsers before complex implementations

### Current Architecture

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router) - ✅ Industry standard
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) - ✅ Popular choice
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS - ✅ Widely adopted
- **Deployment**: Vercel - ✅ Optimal for Next.js
- **Payment**: Stripe (planned) - ✅ Industry standard

### Recent Lesson Learned

The variant system was overcomplicated with custom per-variant quantity controls. **Solution**: Simplified to standard single-variant selection with quantity input - a pattern used by 90% of e-commerce sites.

**Remember**: Users don't care how clever your code is - they care if it works reliably and feels familiar.
