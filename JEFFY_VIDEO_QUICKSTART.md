"Here's how it works..."
"Okay! Got it! Actually... this one I already have!"
"What I did is I tested FIVE or SIX of these in China..."
"...and I found one that's EXCELLENT! Great battery... great pump speed... and it SPARKS!"
"YES! Here's how it works..."
"You take this link... and you send it to 10 of your friends!"
"Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, TikTok, Email - ALL is fine!"
"They tick a little box saying they agree it's a good idea..."

"...and YOU get YOURS for FREE!"
"Just type or speak into THIS box!"
"There we go - ALL DONE!"
"Just get 10 friends to tick the boxes... and your air pump will be on the way!"

```

### THABO VOICE (natural, conversational):

"Hey Jeffy! I've been looking for something..."
"I want a mobile air pump I can keep in my car that also works as a jump starter..."
"...the problem is, the only ones I can find seem to be very cheap... or VERY expensive."
"I just want one that I KNOW will work when I need it... but isn't crazy overpriced."
"Okay... So now I get this for FREE?"
"Excellent! That sounds like a good deal! So how do I get the link?"
"So I can just SPEAK into this box here?"
