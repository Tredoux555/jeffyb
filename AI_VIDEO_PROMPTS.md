## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

**If Kling AI doesn't give good results:**
- Try Pika (pika.art) - simpler, faster
- Try Runway Gen-3 - more cinematic
- Use image-to-video with your Jeffy character image

**If character consistency is an issue:**
- Generate all clips using the same reference image
- Use "maintain character consistency" in prompts
- Consider template-based tools (Animaker) instead

**If this feels overwhelming:**
- Start with just Scene 1, 2, and 9 (intro + hook + CTA)
- That's only 20 seconds - much more manageable!
- Can expand later
